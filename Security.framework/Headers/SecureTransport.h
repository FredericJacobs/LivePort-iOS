#ifndef _SECURITY_SECURETRANSPORT_H_
#define _SECURITY_SECURETRANSPORT_H_

/*
 * This file describes the public API for an implementation of the 
 * Secure Socket Layer, V. 3.0, Transport Layer Security, V. 1.0 to V. 1.2
 * and Datagram Transport Layer Security V. 1.0
 *
 * There no transport layer dependencies in this library;
 * it can be used with sockets, Open Transport, etc. Applications using
 * this library provide callback functions which do the actual I/O
 * on underlying network connections. Applications are also responsible
 * for setting up raw network connections; the application passes in
 * an opaque reference to the underlying (connected) entity at the 
 * start of an SSL session in the form of an SSLConnectionRef.
 *
 * Some terminology:
 *
 * A "client" is the initiator of an SSL Session. The canonical example
 * of a client is a web browser, when it's talking to an https URL. 
 *
 * A "server" is an entity which accepts requests for SSL sessions made
 * by clients. E.g., a secure web server. 
 
 * An "SSL Session", or "session", is bounded by calls to SSLHandshake()
 * and SSLClose(). An "Active session" is in some state between these
 * two calls, inclusive.
 * 
 * An SSL Session Context, or SSLContextRef, is an opaque reference in this
 * library to the state associated with one session. A SSLContextRef cannot
 * be reused for multiple sessions.
